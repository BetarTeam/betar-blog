Hi, welcome to our blog !

For those who don't know what [Betar](https://betar.io/) is, I will explain it really quickly, the ones who know can skip this paragraph. Betar is a platform where game developers can post their beta builds and easily find testers to test them. Basically Betar centralizes the alpha/beta testing period into one platform, from getting testers to getting feedback from them. 

This is going to be the blog of our team where we are posting regular platform updates, new games, team updates and more about Betar and betar testing.

If you haven't [signed up](https://betar.io/users/sign_up) make sure you do, and if you are alredy in you can now start testing games [here](https://betar.io/games/) :)

We know the design is not super fancy (it actually is the default theme of Jekyll eheh) but as always we love to get your feedback, don't hesitate on sending it to team@betar.io we will be back to you as soon as possible.

We will be back with more, 

Jo√£o Bernardo
